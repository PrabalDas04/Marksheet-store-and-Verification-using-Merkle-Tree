## Project title
Marksheet authenticity and public verification using Merkle Tree

## Collaborators
Prabal Das, Bishaka Sarkar

## Mentors
Dr. Laltu Sardar, Dr. Ritankar Mandal

## Date and Place
IAI, CREST, Kolkata, Dec. 2022

## Compilation Guide
 $ gcc project.h project.c project_test.c -lm
 $ ./a.out
 
  This is not supported by Visual Studio Code IDE by some reasons, So better to run in Ubuntu GCC compiler IDE.

## Input and Output file
 input_project_name.txt & output.txt
 
## Description
In this project we constructed the Merkle Tree by SHA-256 hash function and computed the root of the tree from the input file.
The path from root to a (leaf node)student's marksheet hash will be printed in the marksheet.
Any one can compute the root from the marksheet and verify this root which will be uploaded in University website(secure place).
Any further change in the marksheet(fraud) will be detected by the verifier since it will not match with the correct root. 

## Further Improvements
Although we have computed the Merkle tree and the path for reaching to each leaf nodes from root, but our goal is not fulfilled yet. There not further improvements:
=> Verification code is not written. It is ongoing.
=> The program runs for power of 2 no of students. It need to be run for any no of students.
